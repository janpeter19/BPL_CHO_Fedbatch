    "This notebook deals with CHO fedbatch cultivation and recombinant protein production is included. First we make a check of the model by comparing a simulation result with corresponding published diagram. Then we take a closer look at the start-up strategy to keep the by-product formation low. After that we investigate at a whole cultivation and see the impact of feeding strategy on both cell growth and protein production where a trade-off is needed in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model used takes its inspiration from the microbial bottleneck models as described in the original papers [1] and [2] and reformulated and studied in [3]. The laboratory cultures used for model validation in [1] did produce MAb (against part of IgG) but no MAb-data was presented. The paper focus on viable and non-viable cell concentrations only. The original model is in section 5 expanded with the classical empirical Luedeking-Piret model recombinant protein production, see chapter 5 in [4]. In this way can get more insight into choice of feeding profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction with the compiled model as FMU is mainly through the simplified commands: par(), init(), newplot(), simu() etc. The last simulation is always available in the workspace and called 'sim_res'. The command describe() brings mainly up description infomration from the actual Modelica code from the FMU but is complemented with information given in the dedicated Python setup-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is to demonstrate how simulations and varyiing conditions can provide some process insight that can support the experimental work. I hope that at the end of this session you are ready to formulate your own questions you want to address with simulations - and you can just go on in this notebook! Just press the field \"+Code\" in the upper left part of notebook interface and you get a new \"cell\" where you write your own code. You can copy and paste from cells above using ctrl-c and ctrl-v as usual and edit the cell. When your are ready to execute the cell just press the \"play button\" to the left in the cell or press shift-enter as in \"ordinary\" Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a session you may want to save your own notebook. That you can do on your Google Drive account and I refer to Colab instructions for how to do this. It is easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

    "At the end of the original paper section 5 in [1], the derived model is used to find an optimal feeding profile for high final cell concentration. It is stated that protein productivity is assumed to be mainly positively growth associated and therefore optimization of cell concentration is very similar to optimization of protein product. The optimization of feed profile is done with differnt structures of the feed profile. All of them have a start-time and all of them has a fixed amount of substrate and concentrations in the media are also the same. \n",

    "* The first optimzation is for a feed profile similar to the experimental, i.e. after start the feed rate remains constant throughout the cultivation. Thus the start time and the actual feed rate are optimized. The result was that the start time was about the same as expermentally but the feed rate was 50% higher, see Figure 7 and Figure 10 in [1]. \n",

    "\n",
    "In short we have done the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model was checked by comparing the simulation results with one of the published diagrams [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "* The common startup-procedure with 3 days batch cultivation can be questioned. We found that by shorten it to 2 days, and giving smaller feed rate day 3, byproduct formation can be kept lower at the prize of just a bit lower cell concentration. Similar idea was shown in section 2.1 in [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the original paper the experimental feeding strategy was to keep the substrate feed at a constant lower level. The authors made a point of that the optimal feeding strategy should be exponential for maximal cell production. This is an insight derived from the bottle-neck model and they showed that through simulation optimization [1]. However, there was no experimental support to confirm the results. The optimal cell growth feedprofile simulation was just reproduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To optimize recombinant protein production we must include production in the model. Here we do that with the empirical model that distinguish between growth-associated and non-growth-associated protein production, see chapter 5 in [4]. For a class of CHO-processes the recombinant protein productivity is acutally negatively affected by cell growth. Simulation of the original model extended with such a protein production model shows that keeping the substrate feed rate constant as the cell culture grows, giving less and less feed per cell, actually can give higher protein production than an increaeing feed rate. Simulation confirms this idea. The results gives some possible background to why the constant feed rate was used experimetnally in the original paper [1].\n"
