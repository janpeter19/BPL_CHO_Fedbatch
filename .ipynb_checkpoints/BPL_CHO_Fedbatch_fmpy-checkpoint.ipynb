    "This notebook deals with CHO fedbatch cultivation and recombinant protein production is included. First we make a check of the model by comparing a simulation result with the corresponding published diagram. We take a look at viable and dead cells and introduce cell lysis and negative effects on viable cell growth. Then we take a closer look at the start-up strategy to keep the by-product formation low. After that we investigate a whole cultivation and see the impact of feeding strategy on both cell growth and protein production where a trade-off is needed in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model used takes its inspiration from the microbial bottleneck models as described in the original papers [1] and [2] and reformulated and studied in [3]. The laboratory cultures used for model validation in [1] did produce mAb (against part of IgG) but no mAb-data was presented. The paper focus on viable and non-viable cell concentrations only. The original model is expanded with a state for lysed cells coming from dead cells [5, 7]. Further the lysed cell material is described as having a toxic negative effect on viable cell growth rate [5]. The character of this lysed cell material is further described in [6]. The original model is in section 6 further expanded with the classical empirical Luedeking-Piret model recombinant protein production, see chapter 5 in [7]. In this way can get more insight into choice of feeding profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dead cell measurements presented in [1] is difficult and prone to errors, personal communication [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interaction with the compiled model as FMU is mainly through the simplified commands: par(), init(), newplot(), simu() etc. The last simulation is always available in the workspace and called 'sim_res'. The command describe() brings mainly up description infomration from the actual Modelica code from the FMU but is complemented with information given in the dedicated Python setup-file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is to demonstrate how simulations and varyiing conditions can provide some process insight that can support the experimental work. I hope that at the end of this session you are ready to formulate your own questions you want to address with simulations - and you can just go on in this notebook! Just press the field \"+Code\" in the upper left part of notebook interface and you get a new \"cell\" where you write your own code. You can copy and paste from cells above using ctrl-c and ctrl-v as usual and edit the cell. When your are ready to execute the cell just press the \"play button\" to the left in the cell or press shift-enter as in \"ordinary\" Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a session you may want to save your own notebook. That you can do on your Google Drive account and I refer to Colab instructions for how to do this. It is easy.\n",

    "Good luck!"

    "## 3 Extending the model with cell lysis\n",
    "A common experience in fedbatch cultivation of CHO is a slow decrease of viable cell number after the peak concentration is reached. This can be described in terms of accumulation of various toxic material during cultivation [5] and further characterized in [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The orginal model [1] does include cell death but not that dead cell concentration has any effect on the culture. The decrease in the viable cell concentration Xv in the previous simulation is actually just an effect of an increased volume of the reactor broth, i.e. a dilution effect. By instead plotting viable cell number VXv instead of Xv this fact is obvious. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model can easily be extended by including a state for lysed cells VXl that is a variable that reflect the dead cells that have degraded into molecules. This lysis process is briefly outlined on page 195 in [7] and further discussed in [5, 6]. A measure Xl is released of cellular content like DNA or some enzyme like LDH [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Important is that the lysed material Xl has a negative effect of viable cell growth and here modelled as an increase in cell death rate. Here just added as a linear term k_toxix*Xl added to the original function of mu_d(G, Gn). The Xl may have a toxic effect also on recombinant protein production but not further studied here. \n",

    "\n",
    "At the end of the original paper section 5 in [1], the derived model is used to find an optimal feeding profile for high final cell concentration. It is stated that protein productivity is assumed to be mainly positively growth associated and therefore optimization of cell concentration is very similar to optimization of protein product. The optimization of feed profile is done with differnt structures of the feed profile. All of them have a start-time and all of them has a fixed amount of substrate and concentrations in the media are also the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first optimzation is for a feed profile similar to the experimental, i.e. after start the feed rate remains constant throughout the cultivation. Thus the start time and the actual feed rate are optimized. The result was that the start time was about the same as expermentally but the feed rate was 50% higher, see Figure 7 and Figure 10 in [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The second optimization is for a feed profile with not just one increase but three steps of increase of feed rate. The results is a somwehat higher final cell concentration, see Figure 11.\n",

    "## 7 Summary\n",
    "In short we have done the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 2: The model was checked by comparing the simulation results with one of the published diagrams [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 3: The original model was extended with a state for lysed cells and also included with modelling the toxicity of lysed cells increasing the cell death rate [5]. With typical values we could model a typical decrease in viable cell count during the later part of the cultivation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 4: The common startup-procedure with 3 days batch cultivation can be questioned. We found that by shorten it to 2 days, and giving smaller feed rate day 3, byproduct formation can be kept lower at the prize of just a bit lower cell concentration. Similar idea was shown in section 2.1 in [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 5: In the original paper the experimental feeding strategy was to keep the substrate feed at a constant lower level. The authors made a point of that the optimal feeding strategy should be exponential for maximal cell production. This is an insight derived from the bottle-neck model and they showed that through simulation optimization [1]. However, there was no experimental support to confirm the results. The optimal cell growth feedprofile simulation was just reproduced here.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 6: The model was further extended to include recombinant protein production. Here we do that with the empirical model that distinguish between growth-associated and non-growth-associated protein production, see chapter 5 in [7]. Now we can study optimization of recombinant protein production. For a class of CHO-processes the recombinant protein productivity is acutally negatively affected by cell growth. Simulation of the original model extended with such a protein production model shows that keeping the substrate feed rate constant as the cell culture grows, giving less and less feed per cell, actually can give higher protein production than an increaeing feed rate. Simulation confirms this idea. The results gives some possible background to why the constant feed rate was used experimetnally in the original paper [1].\n",
