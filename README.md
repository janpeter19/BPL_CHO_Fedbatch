# BPL_CHO_Fedbatch

This example of cultivation of CHO culture using fedbatch technique is in laboratory scale. The model describes by-products (lactate and ammonia) formation at over-feeding based on a publication. The original model is extended to describe also recombinant protein production. Simulation is done using an FMU from Bioprocess Library *for* Modelica. Below a diagramwith a typical simulation that you will get at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
